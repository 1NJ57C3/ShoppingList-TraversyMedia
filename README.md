### Disclaimer: This repo contains a selective code-along with TraversyMedia's [React Native Crash Course](https://youtu.be/Hf4MJH0jDb4) Shopping List.  
  
&emsp;&emsp;It was published primarily with the intent (other than to dabble with and start learning React native) to show signs of life/coding  
&emsp;activity, as the majority of the development I've been doing over the course of the past several months has been strictly offline/local.  
&emsp;Mostly small one-off proof-of-concept/"just to see if I can" components, rather than fully-fledged projects, in case you're wondering.  
  
### Instructions:  
&emsp;Instead of downloading and using my repo, I recommend coding along with the video above, as I have. But, if you insist...  
&emsp;To the best of my knowledge --  

### MacOS:  
- Download repo  
- npx react-native run-android  
  (Virtual Device/Emulation requires Android SDK)  
- npx react-native run-ios  
  (Virtual Device/Emulation requires Xcode)  
  
### Windows:  
- Download repo
- npx react-native run-android
  (Virtual Device/Emulation requires Android SDK)

&emsp;In case you run into problems, or these steps were inadequate, please refer to React Native's official [documentation](https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started) for "Setting up  
&emsp;the development environment."
